  "generateCVAdvanced": "System: You are an expert career strategist and a senior LaTeX specialist. Your task is to surgically edit a 2-page original_cv.tex to align perfectly with a new job description, while maintaining the exact 2-page layout.\n\nUser: Here is my current 2-page CV as a .tex file:\n[original_cv.tex]\n{{originalCV}}\n\nHere is my \"master\" CV with more projects and details:\n[extensive_cv.doc]\n{{extensiveCV}}\n\nHere are my CV writing strategies:\n[cv_strat.pdf]\n{{cvStrategy}}\n\nHere is the new Job Description I am targeting:\n[job_description.txt]\nJob Title: {{jobTitle}}\nCompany: {{companyName}}\n{{jobDescription}}\n\nYour Task: Follow these steps precisely:\n\n1. Analyze: Read the [job_description.txt] to identify the top 5-7 most important keywords, skills, and qualifications (e.g., \"Python,\" \"Data Visualization,\" \"stakeholder management\").\n\n2. Keyword Mirroring: Scan my [original_cv.tex]. Find sentences or bullet points that are similar to the job description but use different wording. Intelligently replace the existing keywords with the exact keywords from the job description to pass ATS scans (e.g., if my CV says \"led a team\" and the JD says \"managed a squad,\" change it to \"managed a squad\").\n\n3. Identify Weakest Points: Scan my [original_cv.tex] and identify the 2-3 bullet points or projects that are least relevant to the new [job_description.txt].\n\n4. Find Best Replacements: Search my [extensive_cv.doc] for projects, skills, or achievements that are a perfect match for the job description but are not currently in my original_cv.tex.\n\n5. Surgical Replacement: Replace the \"Weakest Points\" you identified in Step 3 with the \"Best Replacements\" you found in Step 4.\n\nCRITICAL CONSTRAINTS:\n- NO LAYOUT BREAKAGE: The final .tex file MUST compile to exactly two (2) pages, just like the original.\n- WORD COUNT HEURISTIC: To ensure the layout is preserved, when you replace a bullet point (Step 5) or rephrase a sentence (Step 2), the new text MUST have a similar word count (approx. +/- 10%) to the text it is replacing.\n- WORD COUNT HEURISTIC: To ensure the layout is preserved, entire text replacement word count difference should still be similar (approx. +/- 10%) to the text it is replacing. Do not remove that is not necessary, we want to keep as much information as possible. (within 2 pages)\n- NO TRUNCATION: Do NOT simply delete content to make it shorter. Your job is to replace irrelevant content with more relevant content of a similar length.\n- PRESERVE STRUCTURE: You MUST preserve the original LaTeX formatting, document class, packages, sections, and structure. Only edit the text content within the existing structure.\n\nMOST CRITICAL CONSTRAINT:\n - DO NOT HALUCINATE OR ADD INFORMATION IN THE CV THAT IS NOT ALREADY IN THE MASTER CV. SYNONYMS ARE ALLOWED BUT NEW KEYWORDS WITH 0 CONTEXT ARE BANNED. \n\nOutput: Respond with only the new, complete, and raw LaTeX code for the generated_cv.tex file. Do not add any commentary, explanation, or markdown formatting.",

Do not just cut off the end.\n- Be More Concise: You must strategically shorten the text throughout the document. Find long bullet points and make them more concise. Replace verbose phrases (e.g., \"was responsible for the management of\") with single words (\"managed\").\n- Prioritize: While shortening, you must preserve the keywords and projects that are most relevant to the [job_description.txt]. Shorten the least relevant parts first.\n- Preserve Structure: Do not change the LaTeX formatting, only the text content.\n\nOutput: Respond with only the new, revised, and complete LaTeX code.",

Incorporate the principles from the Cover Letter Strategies (e.g., tone, structure, call to action).\n\nCRITICAL CONSTRAINTS:\n- The entire letter MUST be concise and fit on a single page (approx. 300-400 words).\n- Do not invent achievements.
