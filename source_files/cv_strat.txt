CV Strategy Guide

Key Principles for Writing an Effective CV:

1. Tailor to the Job Description
- Mirror the language and keywords used in the job posting
- Highlight experiences that directly match required qualifications
- Quantify achievements with specific metrics and numbers

2. Keep it Concise
- Aim for 2 pages maximum for experienced professionals
- Use bullet points instead of paragraphs
- Remove outdated or irrelevant experiences

3. Use Action Verbs
- Start each bullet point with strong action verbs (Led, Developed, Implemented, Managed)
- Avoid passive language

4. Quantify Achievements
- Include specific numbers: percentages, dollar amounts, team sizes
- Show impact and results, not just responsibilities
- Use the STAR method (Situation, Task, Action, Result)

5. Format for ATS (Applicant Tracking Systems)
- Use standard section headings
- Avoid tables, graphics, or unusual formatting
- Include keywords from the job description naturally

6. Highlight Relevant Skills
- List technical skills that match the job requirements
- Group skills logically (Languages, Frameworks, Tools)
- Only include skills you can demonstrate in an interview

7. Professional Summary
- Write a 2-3 sentence summary at the top
- Highlight your unique value proposition
- Tailor it to the specific role

8. Recent Experience First
- Use reverse chronological order
- Focus more detail on recent and relevant roles
- Older experience can be summarized briefly
